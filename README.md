## TROUBLESHOOTING: POTENTIAL ERRORS

While working with the QT Framework, you might encounter an issue where an error like `checktestcaseresult() not ready` is displayed. If you face this error, follow these steps to troubleshoot:

1. Click on the error in your IDE; in my case, there are four warnings, so I click on the second one.

2. The IDE will open a file in QT, and the line causing the error (usually the case 7) will be highlighted.

3. Comment out the problematic line, save the file, and then rerun your program.

This should resolve the issue and allow you to proceed without the error.
